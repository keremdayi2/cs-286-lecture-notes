# CS 286 Lecture 5: Leader-Follower Flocking and Introduction to Consensus
### Announcements
* Readings: Do we have to understand the papers in their entirety? (yes but no, some proofs might be difficult to understand)
* Programming assignments grading: Implement the original algorithm as requested, provide observations, descriptions of any corner cases and how you dealt with them. Describe your implementation/rules
* Relation to the final project:
* Discussing with classmates and forming submission groups for final projects this week.

1. Move and Sense
2. WiFi Sensor for Robots (WSR-toolbox)
3. Sensor Fusion & Mapping

Generally, two weeks for deliverables. Each mini-hack has a deliverable which is a new capability that you will be asked to implement on the robot platforms.

### Last Time:
* Heterogeneous robots & task allocation
### Algebraic Connectivity
* Fiedler Value: 
### Potential Functions:
* High costs to behaviours that we want to avoid. Minimize cost

$$H_c(q_i, q_i^c)= \frac{1}{2}k_c\|q_i-q_i^c\|^2$$
Simple quadratic functions, convexity, simply differentiable

* **Stable**, **Locally Attractive**, **Unstable**.
